# Letterx

+ This is an unfinished version - currently only the `/compose` is fully functional. 
+ Other page are just for show, can't actually do anything. 
+ Got too lazy and the procrastination bug bit me hard. 
+ Will finish it... someday when I feel like it.

# What Can It Do?
Currently it can:
- Upload letters (with attachments if you want) to walrus
- Record the returned `objectid` in the contract 

Coming soon... maybe:
- Browse public letters (when we stop being antisocial)
- Manage your personal letters
